## PyBank

My name is Oscar Lopez, an University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp student. In this activity, I was task with creating a Python notebook to analyze the financial records of a company. I was provided with a budget data set file including profit and losses.
I needed to analyze the records to calculate the total numbers of months included in the file, the net amount, the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period, the greatest increase in profits over the entire period and the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

This activity challenged my Python foundation understanding as loading and retrieving data from CSV files, naming variables correctly and understanding of loops and if statements.
